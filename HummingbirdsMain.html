    <h1>  You <i> Can </i>Attract Hummingbirds </h1>
    Many people don't believe they can attract hummingbirds to their yards. However, this is not true.
    With the right plants and a few feeders you can entice hummingbirds to visit your yard all season long.
    <br>

    <h2> You'll need: </h2>

    <h2> Feeders  </h2>
    Hummingbirds will happily visit your feeders if you fill them with nectar. They like a mix of 4 parts table sugar to 1 part tap water. 
    Be sure to boil the water before mixing it with the sugar. This will kill any bacteria present that might make the hummingbirds sick.
